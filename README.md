# 30 days of javascript to learn by doing

# Foreword

The purpose of this course/series of excercises is to hone your skills and improve your knowledge of Javascript. 
You‚Äôre not alone. Whether you are just starting or already have some knowledge on the field,  the idea is to not go alone. Let's learn as a community, ask your . This is is the start of our path to understanding Javascript. 

I Agree with Atgetify with that (YOU DONT KNOW JAVASCRIPT PREFACE) most of us JS developers aim to learn "just enough" to get by, without ever forcing ourselves to learn exactly how and why the language behaves the way it does. Also, and again in sintony with Kyle, I am not content at stopping once something just works, and not really knowing why. I really need to get to the meat of the problem and fully understand its underlying reasons on why something works the way it does. If I don`t do that, a sense of emptiness revolves around my head and makes me feel unhappy with my finished work. As Jake -- says:  When you strive to comprehend your code, you create better work and become better at what you do. The code isn‚Äôt just your job anymore, it‚Äôs your craft.

We don't really know JavaScript, yet, but if you join me and dig into this series, we will. Javascript awaits for us.

Going along the words of Jenn Lukas on [You don`t know Javascript by Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20%26%20going/foreword.md):

> The more you are exposed to JavaScript, the clearer it becomes.

## Aknowledgments 

This course is inspired by and based on [The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), I strongly suggest you enroll in It if you want to dive deep into learning javascript. Wanna read more? head over to [sources](#sources). 


## Summary

JavaScript is awesome. It's easy to learn partially, and much harder to learn completely (or even sufficiently). When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language instead of their lack of understanding. These books aim to fix that, inspiring a strong appreciation for the language you can now, and should, deeply know. (You dont know javascript preface)



### Sources

This series contain a bunch of information and whole passages from other sites, authors, articles and more that I respect and found useful. Eventually,  once I learn how to write, I'll improve them. For now, I'm just gluing some pieces together in order to ease you the pain of having  to search them yourself.  Every quote, and passage will be linked üëáüèªdown hereüëáüèª, in the [sources section](#sources) (smiling emoticon):

- [You don`t know Javascript by Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/up%20%26%20going/foreword.md)
- [The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- [Javascript info](https://javascript.info/)

Even though I haven't actually uploaded a bit from these sites, there's no way I'm not aknowledging these great partners of every developer for their neverending source of information:

- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2687566/learning-javascript-in-one-weekend)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/learn-javascript-b631a4af11f2)

I'll keep adding more sources as I come across with them.
